# Ethereum Blockchain

While introducing bitcoin in 2008, the technocrats focused mainly on its potential to disrupt the fiat currencies and the global financial system. Cryptocurrency’s underlying technology- blockchain was also introduced in the same year. While cryptocurrency primarily focused on financial transactions, blockchain-focused on storing the transaction details in an open public ledger. Blockchain aimed at keeping a single version of the truth, an immutable and auditable information across the globe.

As time-travelled, Blockchain matured and migrated from the first generation to second calling [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/). From mere financial transactions, it modelled to a programable blockchain tailor-fit for any needs.

### **Understanding Ethereum Blockchain**

To simply put, **Ethereum is general-purpose programmable blockchain technology.**

The blockchain was the first of its kind as there was no general-purpose programmable blockchain present at that time. There were barely any other blockchain applications different from bitcoin. Everyone just forked the bitcoin codebase and ran their own bitcoin network.

If you had a use case that could benefit from the inclusion of blockchain technology, the only way to do was to copy and modify the code for bitcoin blockchain. However, it was a very tedious process and needed expertise. This along with some other [cons of the bitcoin](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/bitcoin-limitations/) propelled the formation of Ethereum blockchain technology.

# Ethereum and Bitcoin

Before we read more about the Ethereum blockchain, let us compare Bitcoin and Ethereum.

# Ethereum Formation: The Journey

The bitcoin network came into existence on 3 January 2009, when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the bitcoin’s genesis block. The anonymous founder was then back by many including the young lad **Vitalik Buterin** who founded Ethereum blockchain sometime later.

Vitalik realized the need for a general-purpose programmable blockchain in Bitcoin. And in pursuit of this realization, he proposed a [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) scripting language on top of the Bitcoin blockchain forming Ethereum.

[Anthony Di Iorio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Di_Iorio) wrote: “Ethereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin, myself, Charles Hoskinson, Mihai Alisie & Amir Chetrit (the initial 5) in December 2013. Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood, & Jeffrey Wilcke were added in early 2014 as founders.”

Ethereum development got four phases:

1. 1. Frontier
    2. Homestead
    3. Metropolis
    4. Serenity

Ethereum Evolution is illustrated below.

# Philosophy of Ethereum

Ethereum is a programmable blockchain that stores and executes computer codes for building decentralized contracts and applications. The core principles of the public blockchain are as follows:

**Simplicity:** The protocols should be simple even if space-time inefficiency exists. An average developer should easily grasp and implement the entire specification of the Ethereum network. Any optimization that adds protocol complexity should not be introduced unless it provides substantial benefit.

**Universality:** Ethereum does not have a feature of its own. Instead, it provides a Turing Complete Language (Smart Contracts) that allows the developers to feature it in the way needed.

**Modularity:** Ethereum protocol should be designed as modules of independent nature. If a small change is introduced to a model, the entire protocol stack should work without any modification. The aim is to keep modules fit for other protocols.

**Agility:** The protocol definitions of Ethereum are not set in stone. Each and every modification to the network goes through extreme scrutiny.

**Non-discrimination and non-censorship:** The protocol will not be designed in any way to restrict or prevent a specific activity or mechanism. All the regulatory mechanisms in the Ethereum protocol are designed to prevent harm to the system but not to prevent a specific action. For example, a user can run an infinite loop program on blockchain as long as they are willing to provide the computational fee.
