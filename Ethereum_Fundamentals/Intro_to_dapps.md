# Introduction to DApps

The pioneering dream of the worldwide web was to be the equalizer, a place where open and accurate information is available, a concept fostered by freedom.

One of the fundamental key concepts of the internet in the earlier days was to easily access and share data without any constraints. Imagine a big library and the entire world got its key.

Over the years the vision of free and open internet is yet to accomplish. The current world trend is the prominent internet companies controlling the data and the internet infrastructure.

An example of this centralized structure and how we relied on it was clearly seen when Google (the most famous search engine) stopped for 45 minutes in December 2020. The business was affected, even the lives of normal people were affected.

This is where Ethereum shines as the new internet. The goal was to create a set of tools that will move the information network infrastructure from a centralized, constrained to a decentralized, shared responsible network infrastructure.

The applications built on top of Ethereum came to be known as Decentralized applications (DApps). Business logic can be written as a smart contract using a scripting language on Ethereum.

DApp is an application built on decentralized technology, rather than being built and controlled by a single, centralized entity or company. For instance, let’s take Google Pay. The payment app is built and controlled by a single company: Google. It is Google that defines the logic and conditions for running and processing your payment requests. However, with DApps, the control gets distributed and shared among the network participants. The code is kept open and transparent that anyone can audit and change the instructions.

# DApp Application Stack

A DApp is any application built on top of a decentralized network, like Ethereum. In a DApp the control and responsibilities get distributed and shared among the network participants.

In the current context, DApps on Ethereum has a flexible application stack. The below diagram shows the various technologies (not limited to) used when developing a DApp on Ethereum.

**User Interface:** The user interface can be designed and developed using many frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, SvelteÂ or using simple HTML-CSS-JS combination.

**Libraries and Frameworks:** There are libraries and framework such as Truffle and Web3 which abstracts out the communication with the blockchain.

**Wallets:** Wallets are used for managing your accounts in the blockchain network.

**Smart Contracts:** Smart Contracts are self-executing programs that represent business logic digitally. Smart contracts are written using specific programming languages, which are then compiled and deployed to the blockchain network.

**Blockchain:** Blockchain clients such as Go-Ethereum for connecting to the network or simulations like Ganache are used during development.

**Operating System(OS):** The OS can be either Windows or Ubuntu.

# What is Web3 ?

The world is more connected than ever. Around [5 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/) people are using the internet, which is more than half of the world’s population. The internet gives people the ability to create, share and collaborate freely. This refers to Web2.

Though the internet and other applications provide access to billions of potential users, it comes with its downsides.

Centralization, privacy, censorship, and ownership of digital goods limit the potential of Web2.

Web3-based protocols offer solutions to the said problems. Web3 is a significant upgrade to the internet, nourishing with extra security, identity, trust, and user control layers.

Adding blockchain, Web3 aims to create a truly decentralized internet that lets users freely interact, share, and collaborate globally in a trustless environment.

Blockchain stays at the forefront of revolutionizing Web 3.0, upholding complete decentralization in usage and information access.

**Advantages of Web3:**

- - **Decentralized** – The users of Web3-based protocols do not need to put their trust in centralized authority and also do not need to be concerned about single-point failures.
    - **Private** – Blockchain technologies preserve the users’ privacy, allowing them to choose who and what information they want to share.
    - **Censorship Resistant** – Information stored on public blockchains can not be manipulated, and there are no constraints on the type of data being stored.
    - [**Digital Ownerships**](https://medium.com/blockchain-stories/tokens-and-the-assets-52898a346979) – The inbuilt [NFT](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/) frameworks that blockchain technology provides offer innovative ways to ensure ownership of digital goods.
