# Blockchain Now

Blockchain is the most fancied and celebrated technology in today’s digital world. The blockchain adoption rate is boosting like never before. The global tech world finds immense potential for blockchain to disrupt [finance](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/blockchain-in-banking/), [supply chain](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/blockchain-in-supplychain/), real estate, and many other industry sectors. By 2020, the Blockchain hype got over. Now,

- - _More than 50% global organizations view blockchain as a strategic priority._
    - _Global spending on blockchain solutions is $4 billion (approx.) in 2020. It is expected to reach $11.7 billion by 2022 and_ _$18 billion by 2024._
    - _32% companies are in the development stage of their blockchain project._
    - _84% companies agree using blockchain to a certain degree._
    - _30% evangelists believe China will be a blockchain leader by 2023._
    - _About 3,000 blockchain startups registered on [AngelList](https://angel.co/)._
    - _United States accounts for 56% of the global blockchain investments._

According to International Data Corporation report, the spending on blockchain solutions is expected to rise by 81%.

# The Story About Currency

Any guess how the world looked like before money was invented. It’s a story built on the idea of Barter.

From then on, banks became the intermediary of transactions. Government stepped in to control banks and conduct fair trade. However, soon the situation changed. When iconic [US investment bank Lehman Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers) Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy in 2008, it shook people’s faith in banks. The [financial crisis of 2007-2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008) triggered great depression. Thus a new class of asset, which did not have any backing of bank came into being.

bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, took birth in November 2008, about two months after the Lehman crisis. It was from the scars of the 2008 financial crisis, that a need for a decentralized, transparent, and trustless network took its shape.

# Decentralization: When and Why

#### **Decentralization – Need of the hour**

Better coordination through centralized system. This is what we all assume. But centralization has its own shortcomings. The abuse of power is the biggest downside.

The thought of decentralized networks realized Bitcoin blockchain. Under the network, each node shares processing power. The nodes are independent and distributed across the globe.

**Decentralized** **Blockchain**

Under blockchain, there is a dispersion of functions, powers, people, or things.

For instance:

Decentralization of authority: As no single party has control over the network.

Decentralization of location: As no single location where the network focuses its resources.

Under blockchain, there is no central authority for network governance and no single point for data storage. The power and resource get shared among the different network nodes. The decentralization property thus makes blockchain an immutable and reliable source of information.

# Distributed Ledger Technology & Blockchain

#### ****Distributed Ledgers****

Ledger is a record of transactions. In the typical scenario, the ledger lies in the hands of a single authority. Under the distributed ledger concept, ledger is shared. The ledger’s exact copy is distributed among the group of participants.

Blockchain is a ledger. Blockchain concurrently shares and synchronizes information among network participants. Everyone can access ledger records (transactions) under blockchain. Ledger changes gets reflected among every participant in the network. Blockchain is thus a distributed ledger.

****Distributed Ledger Technologies**** (****DLTs)**** are the technologies following distributed ledger concept among its participants. There is a variety of DLTs. Blockchain is one of them. There are different variants of DLTs based on the network configuration and access to the ledger.

****Blockchain as Distributed Ledgers****

Let’s decipher blockchain as a ledger. Compare blockchain to a notebook. Just like notebook contains pages, blockchain contains blocks. Just as pages carry the data in a notebook, block carries the data in a blockchain. The data in the pages are always connected or linked to one another. Similarly in the blockchain, blocks are connected or linked to each other.

Just like a student seeks the help of his classmate in case of missing notes, in the blockchain, the participating nodes help the crashed nodes to sync up with the rest network. Blockchain is thus a decentralized, distributed, and digital ledger technology. All information is securely stored using cryptographic methods under blockchain. We’ll discuss cryptography shortly.

# Blockchain Features

By now, you should be able to decipher Blockchain features. Let’s see what are the prominent features of blockchain.

- **Immutability:** It implies something cannot be changed or altered. Immutability gets achieved using cryptography and [hashing techniques](https://kbaiiitmk.medium.com/hash-function-the-heart-of-blockchain-fa35e90e0bc1). Once a block gets committed onto the blockchain, it cannot be modified, even if we wanted to.
- **Decentralized System:** The blockchain system is decentralized. There is no centralized authority for controlling the blockchain network. A public blockchain is fully decentralized. Here, anyone can join the network, and it is publicly available. Eg: Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- **Distributed Peer to Peer Network:** Distributed network enables sharing the ledger among network participant nodes.
- **Better Security:** Blockchain systems achieve several layers of security in different ways. No one can easily change any properties of the blockchain network as the blocks in a blockchainÂ are sealed with cryptographic techniques.
