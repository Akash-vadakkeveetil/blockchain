# History and Evolution of Blockchain

Blockchain technology got introduced in 1991 by researchers Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. In the white paper [How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.5300&rep=rep1&type=pdf), Haber and Stornetta explained the use of continuous chain of timestamps for recording information safe. However, it was during the birth of bitcoin in 2008, blockchain was put into real play. bitcoin emerged as a [decentralized form of money](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/how-is-bitcoin-different-from-fiat-currency/). An alternative to government-controlled- fiat money. The founder of bitcoin (Satoshi Nakamoto- one or a group), built blockchain for building a decentralized system worth trusting.

### **Evolutionary Path**

**Blockchain 1.0: Bitcoin Emergence**

In 2008, during the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, Satoshi Nakamoto released the white paper, [Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) . The paper introduced **bitcoin** – the first practical application of blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain introduced an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof rather trust. This allowed people to transact peer to peer without any dependency on third party. With the public unveiling of bitcoin came the public unveiling of Blockchain.

**Blockchain 2.0: Ethereum Development**

Soon after the release of bitcoin, people realized that blockchain could have a life beyond digital currency. All thanks to Vitalik Buterin. Vitalik introduced a programmable blockchain- Ethereum in 2013. Unlike bitcoin, Ethereum could record assets and perform various other functions other than financial transactions. Ethereum blockchain used **smart contracts** for the same.

**Blockchain 3.0: The Future**

The recent years witnessed several blockchains beyond bitcoin and Ethereum. The new addressed the deficiencies of the ancestor blockchains. For example, [Algorand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqYq8C4rZ8c) solves the scalability issues of blockchain. [Polkadot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xyGp-fNUw4) assures better interoperability, transactional scalability, and governance. [NEAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hqX-XAZn5M) enables to drive a more open, interconnected, and consumer-empowered digital world.
