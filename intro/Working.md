# Working of Blockchain

Let’s see the working of Blockchain.

Blockchain works in a decentralized fashion. It allows thousands of computers (nodes) to maintain its records. When a user creates a transaction over a Blockchain network, the requested transaction is broadcasted over the peer-to-peer network. The nodes in the network then validate the transaction. Once the transaction is validated, it is grouped with other verified transactions to create a new block. This block is then secured using [cryptographic principles](https://kbaiiitmk.medium.com/hash-function-the-heart-of-blockchain-fa35e90e0bc1). Each node in the network will create a block. From this one block is selected by the network using some selection criteria. This block is then added to the existing Blockchain network confirming that it is secured and immutable.

**Each blockchain transaction goes through the following steps**.

1. The transaction is broadcast to the blockchain network.
2. The transaction is checked to make sure it’s valid.
3. The validated transaction is added to a block.
4. One block is selected from the network.
5. The selected block is added to the chain.

# Types of Blockchain

Based on the level of decentralization and access, blockchains can be classified as follows:

**Public Blockchain:** Anyone can join and participate in the action. Everyone can see what’s going on.  Eg: [Bitcoin](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/what-is-bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/ethereum-the-world-computer/).

**Private Blockchain:** Single entity governs the action. Used only when the participants of the network are known to each other.

**Consortium Blockchain:** Combines the features of public and private blockchains. It may not be accessible to the public. Multiple parties will be part of the network. Access to the network will be restricted.

Each of these blockchains or distributed ledgers have their own use cases and application areas. We’ll see them in detail later in this course.


# Industries using Blockchain

Blockchain technology has many different uses and businesses are constantly exploring its niches. Industries using blockchain technology are many. Here are a few companies testing the use of blockchain for your understanding.

- **[Carico Cafe Connoisseur](https://carico.biz/)**, the Ugandan company, use blockchain to certify and track its coffee shipments. The company use blockchain for the provenance tracking of the coffee sacks assuring its quality.
- **[Agrocorp](https://agrocorp.com.sg/)**, reckons saving **15-20%** on its trade financing costs using blockchain. The blockchain trade platform directly connects Austrian farmers with customers knocking off middlemen.
- **[B3i](https://b3i.tech/home.html)**,  the Blockchain Insurance Industry Initiative, is into offering new standards, protocols, and network infrastructure anchored by blockchain. It aims to deliver insurance services with lesser administrative costs.
- **[Car Wallets](https://www.riddleandcode.com/car-wallet)** initiates a service that the vehicles themselves pay for the services. Vehicles are made autonomous in payment processes, information sharing (like road conditions), and more.
- [**IBM’s Rapid Supplier Connect**](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2020/04/ibm-rapid-supplier-connect-getting-covid-19-responders-the-equipment-they-need/)  made it possible for buyers and suppliers to reach out to their necessities during Covid pandemic.
