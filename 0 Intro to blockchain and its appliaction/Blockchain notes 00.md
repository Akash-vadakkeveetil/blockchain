# What is Blockchain ?

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger) that can be used for storing information in multiple locations without any centralized monitoring system. This allows people and companies to store and securely transfer information and currency instantly. The transfer of information in blockchain acts [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) without any middlemen or intermediaries.

To understand it better, consider how our current systems work. For communications over the internet, we depend on high-performance computers called servers owned by companies. All our communications go through these servers. The same is the case with money transfers. We depend on banks that will verify and validate our transactions. These servers, institutions, and companies act as intermediaries in our communications and transactions. Blockchain eliminates these intermediaries and offers a [new way of communication](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/transaction-flow-blockchain-networks/). Let us see how blockchain-the distributed ledger technology empower communication..

# How the name Blockchain?

Blockchain got its name from the format it stores data. In blockchain, the data is packaged into “**blocks**“. The blocks later form a chain with other blocks of information, forming –**blockchain**.

**What a block contains?**

Blocks contains information on transactions happening on a blockchain.

**How a block looks like?**

A block contains a header and body. Transactions are stored in the body part and other details in the header.

The blocks are [cryptographically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) verified and chained up to form an [immutable chain of blocks](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/blockchain-features/) called the **blockchain**.

# Blockchain Characteristics

#### **Read below the blockchain characteristics.**

#### Blockchain is decentralized

Blockchain does not store information on a single computer. Instead, it is copied and spread across a network of computers.

#### Blockchain is permanent and secure

Blockchain transactions are cryptographically validated. Cryptography makes blockchain secure and edit-proof.

#### Blockchain is immutable

Every action is recorded and [distributed in blockchain](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/blockchain-features/). It is timestamped and secured using cryptography.

# What Makes Up a Blockchain?

There are three basic parts to every blockchain.

1. **The transaction:** This can be any type of information recorded on the blockchain.
2. **The block:** A bundle of different transactions.
3. **The chain:** All the blocks are linked together.
