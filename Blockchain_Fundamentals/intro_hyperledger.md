# Need for Permissioned Blockchains

We discussed the different types of blockchain; learned how the public blockchain networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum works. Anyone can participate here in the consensus and are incentivized. Permissioned blockchains are different though.

Let’s discuss some of the cases :

**Business Compatibility:** Businesses want only their trade partners to query and update their trade-related data. The blockchain allows entities to restrict access to their trade partners, and it lets the businesses adopt distributed ledgers without revealing their data publically.

**Higher Throughput:** Blockchains like Bitcoin & Ethereum are infamous for being too slow with unacceptable TPS’s (transactions-per-second). Most of the businesses that leverage IT infrastructure cannot afford to tolerate such poor throughput for their infrastructure. Some permissioned blockchains can achieve TPS in the range of few thousand which makes them a viable choice for many businesses.

**Defined Governance:** Permissioned blockchains allow for transparent governance within the network participants. Thus it is less of a challenge to ensure the evolution of the network in permissioned networks.

**Cost-Effective:** Permissioned blockchains do not involve in mining. An algorithm of less computational intensiveness is used.

Some of the key permissioned blockchains are R3 Corda and different Hyperledger projects. Let’s look briefly into each of these permissioned blockchains in the coming units.

# Hyperledger Projects
