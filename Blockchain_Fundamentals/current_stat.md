# Current Trends

_The growth of blockchain since the advent of Bitcoin has been phenomenal. Blockchain can give us numerous benefits. Just like any other technology, many believe that the evolution process of the technology may go even further. Let’s see how far..?_

Decentralized public blockchain applications are thriving, but successful permissioned enterprise blockchain projects are scarce. Users must understand how new advances are supporting the integration of enterprise requirements with public blockchain innovation.

- Mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, including [El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/el-salvador-s-adoption-of-bitcoin-as-legal-tender-is-a-wake-up-call-11625069109048.html) in June 2021.
- Payment network, banking and social network adoption of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) for money movement, with the expected deployment of [central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency) being a key influencer.
- [Decentralized finance](https://ethereum.org/en/defi/) (Defi) applications offer substantially greater financial rewards than traditional finance. Centralized firms like hedge funds have already taken advantage of this.
- Tokenization of assets, including the explosive growth of [NFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) and DeFi tokens, and the promise of tokens linked to physical assets in the future.
- Blockchains such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), [Cardano](https://cardano.org/), and [Solana](https://solana.com/) offering viable cost-effective alternatives to Ethereum chain transactions.
- Monumental progress in blockchain interoperability, including gateways and abstraction middleware, is already used today by DeFi applications.
- Blockchain migration from the proof-of-work (POW) consensus method (still used for Bitcoin) to more energy-efficient consensus methods such as proof of stake (PoS). The ongoing upgrade of Ethereum leads this trend.
# Blockchain in Banking

MAKING BANKING TRANSACTIONS EXTREMELY FASTER. IN TRADITIONAL BANKING, THE
REQUEST WAITS ARE TOO LONG. IT TAKES TWO TO SIX BUSINESS DAYS TO COMPLETE A
REQUEST. USING BLOCKCHAIN, TRANSACTIONS CAN BE ACHIEVED IN 10 SECONDS OR
MAYBE LESS.
BLOCKCHAIN CAN REDUCE PROCESSING FEES. IT FACILITATES FASTER PAYMENTS AT
LOWER FEES. CRYPTOGRAPHIC PAYMENTS REDUCE OPERATIONAL COSTS AND BRING
CUSTOMERS CLOSER TO REAL-TIME TRANSACTIONS.
RECORDED DATA IS IMMUTABLE. IT IS EASY FOR UNTRUSTED PARTIES TO COME TO AN
AGREEMENT OVER A STATE OF DATA. ALSO, THE BANKING PROTOCOLS SUCH AS KNOW
YOUR CUSTOMER AND CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE REGULATIONS CAN BE EASILY FURNISHED
WITH BLOCKCHAINS REDUCING MONEY LAUNDERING.
SMART CONTRACTS COULD AUTOMATE EVERY MANUAL PROCESS LIKE COMPLIANCE,
CLAIMS, OR WILLS. ADOPTING BLOCKCHAIN, BETTER GOVERNANCE, AND STANDARDS
AROUND DATA SHARING CAN BE ACHIEVED.


# Blockchain in Healthcare

Blockchain technology is expected to bring qualitative changes in the healthcare sector. It aims to improve **medical record management, insurance claim processes, clinical and biomedical researches**, etc. The blockchain traits like decentralized management, immutable audit trials, data provenances, enhanced security, and privacy are expected to raise the standards of healthcare industry. The distributed technology is anticipated to provide a new model for health information exchanges (HIE) via disintermediating medical records. The most notable blockchain innovation in the industry is the recovery of data rights.

# Blockchain in Government Sector

**Blockchain For Government**

The current bureaucratic model is hierarchical and comes with formal lines of authority. More on, the authority is geographically defined and has a fixed area of work. The decisions always get regulated by the laws and procedures delaying the work getting done.

![](https://learn.kba.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BFP_Images_01.png)

### **Current Challenges in the Sector**

As illustrated above, resources (e.g., data, taxes, fees and payments to the government) are given to governmental authorities by individuals and businesses. These are received by a series of siloed, hierarchical-modelled public sector organizations. Multiple layers of oversight are executed here for transaction verification.

### **Blockchain-Powered Government**

Blockchain for government is expected to provide ease of operations for both government and citizens. Every citizen, including the common man, businesses, and governments, is expected to easily share and access resources over the distributed ledger database. Today,  blockchain supports an array of government and public sector administration activities including

- Legal entities management
- Land registration
- Identity management
- Voting
- Taxation etc.

Let’s see the anticipated advantages.

- Secured storage of government, citizen, and business data.
- Automation and reduction of labor-intensive processes.
- Permissioned access to information and speedy settlement of disputes.
- Reduction of excessive costs related to infrastructure and operations.
- Reducing the potential for corruption and abuse.
- Increasing the trust in government and online civil systems.

****Government Use Cases****

**Estonia****:** The first country to use blockchain on a national level. The Estonian government implemented the DLT technology for its national identity management system called [ID-kaart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_identity_card). This helped the nation to significantly reduce the time that it takes for the government to provide services to its citizens.

**Georgia**: In 2016, Georgia’s National Agency of Public Registry (NAPR) collaborated with Bitfuri Group to implement Blockchain in the land title registry. The collaboration delivered the [first-ever blockchain land registry system](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/inov_a_00276) enhancing citizen’s trust in government, strengthening owner’s rights over the property and reinforcing data security. Today, there are more than [1.5 million land titles registered](https://exonum.com/story-georgia), under this collaboration with an average of 3 minutes of registration time. 

**Switzerland:** The city of Zug implemented blockchain to issue decentralized IDs, known as [uPort](https://www.uport.me/). The government issued [a self-sovereign identity on Ethereum Blockchain](https://consensys.net/blockchain-use-cases/government-and-the-public-sector/zug/) enabling users to control their own data and ensure secure data exchanges. Presently, the ID is used for the municipal services, including the casting of votes.

**Malta:** In Malta, the **Ministry for Education and Employment (MEDE)** adopted [Blockcerts](https://www.blockcerts.org/guide/) for managing the nation’s academic records. The initiative made the ill-timed certification process an easier one. The platform helped the government to seamlessly create, issue, view, and verify the academic credentials of the Maltese citizens for education and employment prospects.

**India:** The state government of Tamilnadu has already come up with a platform called [Nambikkai Inaiyam (NI)](https://tnega.tn.gov.in/page/36) which roughly translates “Trust Link” in Tamil. Via the project the government of Tamilnadu is aiming to establish a single trusted source of truth for creating an efficient fraud resilient system for government processes. Read on **Tamilnadu Blockchain Policy 2020** [here](https://tnega.tn.gov.in/assets/pdf/Blockchan_Policy_TamilNadu.pdf). Likewise, the Telangana government has established the blockchain for **land registry** processes enhancing the security of land records. The move is aimed at ensuring the state government’s data are tamper-proof, secure and updated.

# Challenges of Blockchain

**Performance**

In comparison to legacy systems, the transaction processing speed of a blockchain system is very low. For example, the Ethereum network can process 15 transactions per second, on the other hand, legacy systems can process tens of thousands of transactions per second. Due to the comparatively poor performance of the blockchain network, many do not consider blockchain technology as a viable solution for large-scale applications, which handles millions of transactions per second.

Any number of people can participate in a public blockchain network, and the validators within the network need to solve a complex mathematical puzzle to validate the transactions, that’s how the famous consensus model PoW works. This process takes time, therefore, the transactions the network can process at a time are limited by this method. Many people are looking into the consensus field to increase the transaction processing field. Hyperledger, Corda are some frameworks that have shown promise. But as they try to increase the transaction processing speed, the basic features that make a blockchain is compromised. Energy consumption for the Bitcoin PoW, i.e. the power to run the Bitcoin software and to do transaction validations are estimated to be a minimum of 2.55 gigawatts (GW), which amounts to the energy consumption of 22 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year, which is almost the same as Ireland’s yearly consumption.

**Interoperability**

With an increasing number of people using blockchain technology, the blockchain industry is expanding like never before. Due to this, there are many blockchain networks. The lack of interoperability grants the developers, freedom. Because of this, all the blockchain platforms are in different standards and the communication gap between them is getting wider. It will be difficult to handle all the functions needed by a system by only using blockchain technology, i.e. the blockchain systems cannot completely eradicate the legacy system. A collaborative relationship between the two systems will lead to wonders. So feasible mechanisms should be made to integrate blockchain with legacy systems.

**Network Size**

Blockchain networks are resistant to malicious actors within the network, unlike all other distributed networks. But this requires a large number of network users. If the blockchain network does not have a large number of widely distributed nodes, it can’t reach the full potential for which it was meant to be.

**Human error**

The blockchain is used as a data storage system in many cases, the information stored on a blockchain is not inherently trustworthy. So, the accuracy of the data going to be recorded to the blockchain needs to be confirmed first.

**Security flaws of the technology and of its implementation**

In theory, if 51% of the people within the network make a collaborative effort to tell a lie to the network, the lie will become the truth for that blockchain network, mining pools within the networks can be considered as an attempt towards this theory. The different implementations of blockchain technology have their own implementation flaws just like any other software which can be exploited by a malicious actor in the network to gain an upper hand. The inefficient design of the technology is stopping blockchain technology from achieving its true potential. Blockchain is still a budding technology. It still needs many more upgrades to reach its full potential.

The lack of collaboration between the blockchain community, the lack of regulations within the network and between the networks can lead to feuds in the future. The lack of an adequate skill set, the lack of people with skills that can tackle the complexity to understand the core of blockchain technology is a hindrance to the development of wonderful solutions.

A company or a system that revolves around privacy will have to tackle many problems if it wants to incorporate the benefits of blockchain technology with its system.

The majority of the public is still not aware of the existence of blockchain technology and the disruptions it can bring to the current systems.

This technology may face many challenges now. It is little doubt that blockchain technology will play a crucial role in both the public and private sectors. In the future, it will play an even more important role than many people think it will do. The current focus should be to make this technology widely available and to improve technological implementations. Let’s not forget that we are in the early days of blockchain.
