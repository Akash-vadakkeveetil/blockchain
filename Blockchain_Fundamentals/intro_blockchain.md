# History and Evolution of Blockchain

Blockchain technology got introduced in 1991 by researchers Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. In the white paper [How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.5300&rep=rep1&type=pdf), Haber and Stornetta explained the use of continuous chain of timestamps for recording information safe. However, it was during the birth of bitcoin in 2008, blockchain was put into real play. bitcoin emerged as a [decentralized form of money](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/how-is-bitcoin-different-from-fiat-currency/). An alternative to government-controlled- fiat money. The founder of bitcoin (Satoshi Nakamoto- one or a group), built blockchain for building a decentralized system worth trusting.

### **Evolutionary Path**

**Blockchain 1.0: Bitcoin Emergence**

In 2008, during the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, Satoshi Nakamoto released the white paper, [Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) . The paper introduced **bitcoin** – the first practical application of blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain introduced an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof rather trust. This allowed people to transact peer to peer without any dependency on third party. With the public unveiling of bitcoin came the public unveiling of Blockchain.

**Blockchain 2.0: Ethereum Development**

Soon after the release of bitcoin, people realized that blockchain could have a life beyond digital currency. All thanks to Vitalik Buterin. Vitalik introduced a programmable blockchain- Ethereum in 2013. Unlike bitcoin, Ethereum could record assets and perform various other functions other than financial transactions. Ethereum blockchain used **smart contracts** for the same.

**Blockchain 3.0: The Future**

The recent years witnessed several blockchains beyond bitcoin and Ethereum. The new addressed the deficiencies of the ancestor blockchains. For example, [Algorand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqYq8C4rZ8c) solves the scalability issues of blockchain. [Polkadot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xyGp-fNUw4) assures better interoperability, transactional scalability, and governance. [NEAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hqX-XAZn5M) enables to drive a more open, interconnected, and consumer-empowered digital world.

# What is Blockchain ?

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger) that can be used for storing information in multiple locations without any centralized monitoring system. This allows people and companies to store and securely transfer information and currency instantly. The transfer of information in blockchain acts [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) without any middlemen or intermediaries.

To understand it better, consider how our current systems work. For communications over the internet, we depend on high-performance computers called servers owned by companies. All our communications go through these servers. The same is the case with money transfers. We depend on banks that will verify and validate our transactions. These servers, institutions, and companies act as intermediaries in our communications and transactions. Blockchain eliminates these intermediaries and offers a [new way of communication](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/transaction-flow-blockchain-networks/). Let us see how blockchain-the distributed ledger technology empower communication..

# How the name Blockchain?

Blockchain got its name from the format it stores data. In blockchain, the data is packaged into “**blocks**“. The blocks later form a chain with other blocks of information, forming –**blockchain**.

**What a block contains?**

Blocks contains information on transactions happening on a blockchain.

**How a block looks like?**

A block contains a header and body. Transactions are stored in the body part and other details in the header.

![](https://learn.kba.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/img-03_Block__1_.png)

The blocks are [cryptographically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) verified and chained up to form an [immutable chain of blocks](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/blockchain-features/) called the **blockchain**.

# Blockchain Characteristics

#### **Read below the blockchain characteristics.**

#### Blockchain is decentralized

Blockchain does not store information on a single computer. Instead, it is copied and spread across a network of computers.

#### Blockchain is permanent and secure

Blockchain transactions are cryptographically validated. Cryptography makes blockchain secure and edit-proof.

#### Blockchain is immutable

Every action is recorded and [distributed in blockchain](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/blockchain-features/). It is timestamped and secured using cryptography.

# What Makes Up a Blockchain?

There are three basic parts to every blockchain.

1. **The transaction:** This can be any type of information recorded on the blockchain.
2. **The block:** A bundle of different transactions.
3. **The chain:** All the blocks are linked together.

# Working of Blockchain

Let’s see the working of Blockchain.

Blockchain works in a decentralized fashion. It allows thousands of computers (nodes) to maintain its records. When a user creates a transaction over a Blockchain network, the requested transaction is broadcasted over the peer-to-peer network. The nodes in the network then validate the transaction. Once the transaction is validated, it is grouped with other verified transactions to create a new block. This block is then secured using [cryptographic principles](https://kbaiiitmk.medium.com/hash-function-the-heart-of-blockchain-fa35e90e0bc1). Each node in the network will create a block. From this one block is selected by the network using some selection criteria. This block is then added to the existing Blockchain network confirming that it is secured and immutable.

**Each blockchain transaction goes through the following steps**.

1. The transaction is broadcast to the blockchain network.
2. The transaction is checked to make sure it’s valid.
3. The validated transaction is added to a block.
4. One block is selected from the network.
5. The selected block is added to the chain.

# Types of Blockchain

Based on the level of decentralization and access, blockchains can be classified as follows:

**Public Blockchain:** Anyone can join and participate in the action. Everyone can see what’s going on.  Eg: [Bitcoin](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/what-is-bitcoin/), [Ethereum](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/ethereum-the-world-computer/).

**Private Blockchain:** Single entity governs the action. Used only when the participants of the network are known to each other.

![](https://learn.kba.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ripple-Logo.png)

**Consortium Blockchain:** Combines the features of public and private blockchains. It may not be accessible to the public. Multiple parties will be part of the network. Access to the network will be restricted.

Each of these blockchains or distributed ledgers have their own use cases and application areas. We’ll see them in detail later in this course.


# Industries using Blockchain

Blockchain technology has many different uses and businesses are constantly exploring its niches. Industries using blockchain technology are many. Here are a few companies testing the use of blockchain for your understanding.

- **[Carico Cafe Connoisseur](https://carico.biz/)**, the Ugandan company, use blockchain to certify and track its coffee shipments. The company use blockchain for the provenance tracking of the coffee sacks assuring its quality.
- **[Agrocorp](https://agrocorp.com.sg/)**, reckons saving **15-20%** on its trade financing costs using blockchain. The blockchain trade platform directly connects Austrian farmers with customers knocking off middlemen.
- **[B3i](https://b3i.tech/home.html)**,  the Blockchain Insurance Industry Initiative, is into offering new standards, protocols, and network infrastructure anchored by blockchain. It aims to deliver insurance services with lesser administrative costs.
- **[Car Wallets](https://www.riddleandcode.com/car-wallet)** initiates a service that the vehicles themselves pay for the services. Vehicles are made autonomous in payment processes, information sharing (like road conditions), and more.
- [**IBM’s Rapid Supplier Connect**](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2020/04/ibm-rapid-supplier-connect-getting-covid-19-responders-the-equipment-they-need/)  made it possible for buyers and suppliers to reach out to their necessities during Covid pandemic.
