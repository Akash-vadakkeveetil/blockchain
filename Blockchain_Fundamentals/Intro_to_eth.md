# Bitcoin Limitations

The significant advantage of Proof of Work consensus is that it makes the network attack computationally expensive. Hence the algorithm repels many network attacks like Spamming or [Distributed Denial of Service.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) Unlike many other algorithms, having a high fraction of native assets (cryptocurrencies) has little to no effect on the PoW consensus. Also, PoW is a highly scalable algorithm. However, it has certain disadvantages.

Disadvantages of Proof of Work

**Complex Architecture:** PoW requires a heavy and complex infrastructure, and the computation requires expensive hardware. This raises the overall infrastructure cost.

**“Uselessness” of Computations:** Miners consume great power for their computational work. The computations remain unused later.

**51% attack:** The algorithm is prone to 51% attack. Attackers can reverse transactions, monopolize generating new blocks and receive rewards if they possess 51% of the total network power.

**Slow Transaction Time:** The Bitcoin network has a block time of approximately 10 minutes. The creation difficulty is adjusted every 2 weeks to maintain the block time. A transaction fee that’s too low gets lower preference by the Bitcoin network and will be delayed.

**High Energy Consumption:** The Proof-of-Work algorithm uses powerful ASIC mining machines that consume a lot of electricity. For example, in China coal mines power the mining machines.

**Transaction Finality:** If a transaction is final, it cannot be rolled back. It’s permanently recorded and immutable. In the Bitcoin network, transactions get reverted by 51% attacks or by hard forks. It is required for six confirmations ( takes approx. 1 hour) in Bitcoin for a transaction to be final.

**Limited Programmability:** Bitcoin network has limited scripting capabilities. Hence, [DApps](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/lessons/decentralized-application/) cannot be build on network.

# Ethereum: The World Computer

Ethereum is the second-generation blockchain ( Blockchain 2.0) that can execute computer code on the blockchain network. It pushed the horizon of the first-generation blockchain (Blockchain 1.0 ) from mere databases to a general platform running decentralized applications and smart contracts.

The open-source, public blockchain platform was founded in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin. Although the technology is built on the decentralization concepts of Bitcoin, it successfully addresses some of Bitcoin’s limitations.

Ethereum got a fully functioning Turing-complete program that can develop smart contracts or execute computer programs. However, Bitcoin has limited scripting capability that limits exploring different transaction opportunities in Bitcoin. Using Ethereum, developers can create rules that govern the blockchain network.

The blockchain trades as Ether (ETH) which is the [second-largest cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/) after bitcoin. Just like bitcoin revolutionized the currency market through the decentralized form of money, Ethereum intends to revolutionize sectors such as governance, social network, land records, certificates, supply chain, voting etc. It intends to be the single blockchain network where all the DApps will be created.

Initially, [Ethereum raised a crowdfund of 18.3 million dollars in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-funded_crowdfunding_projects), becoming the largest crowdfunded project of that time. All thanks to Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Lorio and Charles Hoskinson for coining Ethereum. While Bitcoin catered to distributed data storage, Ethereum catered to distributed data storage and computing. There are thousands of decentralized applications currently deployed and live on the Ethereum network. Ethereum Enterprise Alliance is a global community of blockchain leaders, adopters, innovators, developers, and innovators collaborating towards blockchain for good. Ethereum block time is around 12 seconds and it has a Turing complete smart contract for scripting


# Ethereum Evolution Roadmap

# Philosophy of Ethereum

Apart from a decentralized payment network, the Ethereum blockchain network stores and execute computer codes.

**Ethereum Blockchain and Its Core Principles**

**Simplicity:** The Ethereum protocols should be simple even if space-time inefficiency exists. An average developer should easily grasp and implement the entire specification of the Ethereum network. Any optimization that adds protocol complexity should not be introduced unless it provides substantial benefit.

**Universality:** Ethereum does not have a feature of its own. Instead, Ethereum provides a Turing Complete Language (Smart Contracts) that allows the developers to feature Ethereum the way needed.

**Modularity:** Ethereum protocol should be designed as modules of independent nature. If a small change is introduced to a model, the entire protocol stack should work without any modification. The aim is to keep modules fit for other protocols.

**Agility:** The protocol definitions of Ethereum are not set in stone. Each and every modification to the network goes through extreme scrutiny.

**Non-discrimination and non-censorship:** The protocol will not be designed in any way to restrict or prevent a specific activity or mechanism. All the regulatory mechanisms in the Ethereum protocol are designed to prevent harm to the system but not to prevent a specific action. For example, a user can run an infinite loop program on blockchain as long as they are willing to provide the computational fee.
